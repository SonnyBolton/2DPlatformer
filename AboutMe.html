    <p>I am a solo game developer I started my journey about 3 years ago with Unity making and releasing two very small and low quality games on itch.io aswell I learnt how to code in multiple different languages including c#, c++, JavaScript, HTML, Python and many more. Ive always had a passion for being creative and making and playing video games since I was little. The reason I started doing game developement was because of youtubers I watched before I started like brackeys and CodeMonkey. While learning game developement and different coding languages i also learnt how to code ai in python aswell as code websites using html and css. </p>
