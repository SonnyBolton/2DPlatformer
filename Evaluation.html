    <h1>Artwork and Animations</h1>
    <p>Making my Artwork and Animations for my game wasnt easy but I was able to complete them to a standard I am happy with which has helped me improve on my art skills and feel more confident in what I am Creating. I created multiple pieces of art including tile sets collectables,chests,menus aswell as i gave the player 3 animations which includes running, walking and jumping. I also added animations to my bounce pads by making them compact when bounced on and expand when it lauches you the art i decided to use for this was a mushroom, I also added collectables which I used coin animations with a glitter animation. For the player art i decide on a boy which black clothing and dark brown hair with fire for eyes this fits the style of the game as its set inside a dark cave. For the boss art and animation i used an red alien with multiple legs that has different attacks for the attack art i made rocks and a fireball for the boss to use. I also created spikes for obstacles for the player to try and dodge. The style for the hud worked how I wanted it to look aswell as adding a little player animations and coin animations to the UI gave it a better look and feel for the game</p>
     <p>Even better if i was able to do better walk animations for the boss and attack animations as they are very little and dont really fit the feel of the game as much as all the other animations does. The player animations could of been smoother and fit the player better as there is times where the player animations dosent fit the current movement of the player. The art work for the spikes aswell as the animations as it dosent really work visually as I intended it too as it didnt sit on the platforms the way i wanted it too. Even better if I was able to have multiple different mushroom types to have a varity of colours in the game. It could of been better if the starting game scene was much better as it was just a basic mockup and didnt really fit very well and made the start of the game look a bit bad.</p>
      <p>If i was to do this again i would make sure i improve my animations and use my research and my gdd to help with artwork styles and animations. I would also use research as a way to take inspiration for artstyles that helps attract players and make them feel more immersive inside of the game, I would also use this to come up with smoother animations that fit the style of the game so the whole art style animations ui and menus all fit together to give the game that consistent look throughout. I would also add a background into the game so there isnt just a black background to give more of the feel of the environment that the player is in. Using Research would help with keeping a consistent art style as i am able to look at the games artstyle and see how they fit throughout each piece of art work that they and how i can use that to implement it into my own game.</p>
       <p>Throughout this whole project i have made a total of 3 games which really impacted my progress as it took up alot of time to redraw all my artwork and animations but this also helped improve my art and allow me to draw better animations tilesets and ui even tho i created multiple different games my research never changed i still used the same research and case studies to help inspire the game that i am making allowing me to have a smoother production and a consistent journey through redrawing and reanimating all my assets and actors in the game. Making 3 games impacted alot on progress in a negative way making it slower for me to produce a game but it also had a postive affect as it allowed me to come up with my final artstyle and helped me feel like i produced a good game that looks the way i wanted it too and still uses my GDD and Research to keep the style the same during the whole game. </p> 
    <h1>Sounds</h1>
    <p>I used multiple different sounds within all three of my games improving as the each new game was made which leaded to my final audio which came out really well and sounded how i wanted it too and fit within the game style giving the player a sense of embracement like they are actually in the game and not playing it. I added music to the main menu and the boss fight using 8 bit as the audio style with a dramatic music for boss fight and calm music for the main menu while the player itself had a walk sound jump sound aswell as a running sound. I also added sound when hovering and clicking on the buttons to add a bit more audio into my game the reason i decided to do this was because i noticed when i did my research that games like Hollow Knight and Celeste both have audio when selected menus and hovering over interactable UI. I also had audio when collecting collectables aswell as using jumppads. I also added audio for speech in the game for when the player is speaking or listening to something else speak.</p>
     <p>Even better if i was able to add more audio into the game for example adding music into the first level instead of only having collectable speech and player audio, I also could of made my running sound better as it dosent fit or sound good within my game and ruins my audio feel throughout the whole game. Even better if i used my research more to help come up with player audio to correctly have a smooth audio for every mechanic the player can do and every mechanic inside of the game itself. It could of also been better if i had more of a varity of audio playing when the player is moving so itself like it walking on different types of ground for more affective audio for the player this is where using my research and GDD more could of helped me come up with better audio for the game. In the end i feel like making 3 games really helped improve my audio skills when creating games throughout the whole project i still stuck with the same research and case studies to help fuel the process for making my game and making it sound the way i wanted it too.</p>
      <p>Throughout the whole project the audio changed loads which impacted my time as creating audio took alot of time to do and implement into the game but in the end it helped make the game sound better and improved my skills at making audio and making it sound good which is where using my research helped me create audio that fits in the game and makes it feel good for the player to hear while moving around the game and navigating around the menus.</p>
    <h1>Movement and Gameplay Mechanics</h1>
    <p>Making my Movement and game play mechanics went really well i used alot of my research to help come up with my player movement and mechanics to use within my game although i restarted 3 times my core movement never changed and i always followed the same research document I used alot of mechanics from games like Hollow Knight and Celeste to help come up with my movement and mechanics using my research helped me underline what mechanics i need in my game and how to implement it and how it will help make the player feel. I used multiple different mechanics and movement in my game such as player movemovement which includes moving, i also have bounce pads that launch the player a set height in a set direction i also have a dialogue system that gives a bit of story and narrative to the game aswell as a chest that has a spirit inside of which you must complete its task to complete the level i also have a boss that roams and when it gets close to the player it picks a random attack out of the attacks it has and trys to hit the player with the attack to deal damage. The buttons in the menu all make audio when hovered and clicked on aswel as change colors i noticed games like Hollow Knight and Celeste have a feature the same when i did my research. </p>
     <p>Even better if i was able to make my player movement a little more smooth and controlable in the air aswell as i needed to fully fine tune the launch pads to smoothly launch the player in the direction and height i set it to do. Aswell as i needed to make the bosses movement and attacking alot smoother also as i noticed when doing my research that the player movement and enemy movement and attacks are very smooth and fine tuned using the research has helped me notice what i need to do to make things better to improve the playability of my game and make it more fun for the player to play. I also needed to fix the spike mechanic in my game to damage the player as sometimes when the player jumps over it some times it damages and kills the player even tho the player never landed or touched the spike. Using my research i now know how i did my spikes wrong and how i should of actually done it so it works correctly without any accidental damage done to the player.</p>
      <p>If i was to redo my project i would use my research to correctly create my mechanics smoothly and make sure it gives a smooth experience for the player to play. Even tho i restarted my idea 3 times it impacted my project in a postive way as i have created a game i am happy with even tho it costed alot of time i had a finish project to the standards that i like to set and work towards. Throughout my whole project i stuck using the same research to help with my game and create a fun and playable project for people to play and enjoy. Even tho i spent alot of time remaking my whole project it improved my coding skills and allowed me to code quickly and correctly to a high standard that dosent produce bugs or qlitches within the game.</p>
    <h1>User Interaction</h1>
    <p>The User has a couple interactions during the game including a console, collectables and a chest and bouncepads. The console is what the player uses to start level 1 i used jamanji as inspiration for this as it sucks the player into the game. The player can also walk over coins to interact and pick them up which helps the player complete the level i saw that during my research most games have some sort of collectable. The bounce pads are used when the player jumps on it and then launchs this allows the player to get to places a normal jump wouldnt get them too. The chest is a interactive narative which allows the player to complete tasks to complete the level.</p>
     <p>Even better if i added more interaction into the game and used my research to find more interaction i can add into the game to make it more interactive and fun for the player to embrace themselves in and play. During research i found alot of interactive mechanics i could of added into my game that i didnt get the chance to add and use in my game even tho i wanted to add them. It could of been better if my interaction was alot smoother than it currently is.</p>
      <p>If i was to restart my project again i would use my research to find more user interaction to add into my game to make it more fun and playable for the player to have a more fun experience when playing. I would also make sure that they are correctly placed to ensure replayability and smooth gameplay instead of janky gameplay which would allow the player to have a smoother play through of the game.</p>
    <h1>Use of Narrative</h1>
    <p>I use a bit of narrative within my game, i use narrative at the start of the game to tell the player the start of the story and what to do next to move on after the player has done that they have another piece of narrative and they also have a few pieces of narrative with the chest that the player can interact with allowing them to get tasks i noticed that a few games also use this approach in my research so i used that as inspiration for my game and make a similar system. </p>
     <p>I could of added more narrative into my game including when you complete the game or even when the player beats the boss but i didnt have enough time being that i made 3 different projects till i got to a project i was happy with and liked making this impacted the ammount of narrative i can have in my game as it used alot of time readding narative into the game that i already had which could of been used to code more narrative instead. Using research i found alot of narrative i could of used in the game to add more fun and story into the game allowing the player to feel more embraced into the game.</p>
      <p>If i was to restart this project i would make sure to add more narrative and story into my game and use my research to help come up with a story and ways to implement it smoothly for the player to gradually learn the story behind the game and want to play more to find out the full story of the game and how the player ended up where it did and why it had to complete all of those tasks and defeat a boss to escape and come back to reality.</p>
    <h1>Comparision between my game and my case studies</h1>
    <p>My game and Celeste are similar in certain aspects they are both 2d platformers with a story and interaction for the player. The art style between the two games are different my game is made with pixel art and Celeste isnt, Celeste has a way bigger story and more interaction and smoother gameplay than what i managed to only have a small story and not alot of interaction even tho i didnt have as much time as Celeste did my game takes alot of inspiration from celeste in ways of player Movement and mechanics that the player can use and move around with by doing advanced movement to get to higher places which Celeste uses too. Hollow Knight also uses the same as my game and celeste making all games similar in a way but still way different based on story mecchanics and gameplay. Both Celeste and Hollow Knight use a different art style than my project aswell as audio and gameplay differs from game to game.</p>
