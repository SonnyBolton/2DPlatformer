        <h1>Research Tools and Techniques</h1>
        <p>There is numerous ways of research tools and techniques that can be used for creation of video games. You have your primary research which includes data collection from different sources you and A game developer may conducting playtests to observe how players interact with a new game mechanic and how it is performing. The feedback and data gathered will help improve the game before its release, which will help you improve. You have secondary research, which includes being collected by someone else in witch will provide information and finding out information from conducting surveys as such, Qualitative research is where you will look at it as a non-numerical data point of view were you will analyze it through non-numerical data, Quantitative Research, is where you look at it as a numerical data point of view  Quantitative research is also mostly used to standardize data collection and generalizing better informative findings.   </p>
        <p>Researching games is essential for making successful 2D games because it helps developers understand what works and what doesnt in game design. By studying popular and well-made 2D games, you can gain insights into gameplay mechanics, storytelling, art styles, and player engagement strategies. These insights are crucial in creating a game that not only functions well but also captures the interest of players.</p>
        <p>One major benefit of researching games is learning how to structure gameplay mechanics. Many successful 2D games, like Celeste or Hollow Knight, have perfected their control systems, making sure that the players actions feel smooth and responsive. Understanding how these mechanics are implemented can guide developers in designing fluid controls that enhance the players experience. Additionally, research helps identify common pitfalls, such as frustrating difficulty spikes or confusing user interfaces, so developers can avoid them in their own games. </p>
        <p>Researching other games also provides inspiration for art direction and level design. Whether its the pixel art of classic platformers or the hand drawn aesthetics of modern indie games, looking at a variety of styles can spark creativity and help you decide on a visual approach that suits your game. You can also analyze how different games use visual storytelling to create immersive worlds without relying heavily on dialogue or text. </p>
        <p>Lastly, player feedback from existing games offers valuable lessons. By reading reviews and forums, developers can understand what players love or dislike in certain games. This knowledge can help you anticipate player expectations and design features that resonate with your target audience.  </p>
        <p>In conclusion, researching games is a critical part of developing 2D games because it equips you with knowledge about what makes a game enjoyable, visually appealing, and engaging for players. This also allows you to know what audio fits what genre of game that you are making.  </p>
        <h3>Qualitative Research. Pritha Bhandari. (2022). What Is Qualitative Research?</h3>
        <p> Qualitive research is something to do with collecting and analyzing data to understand people's behavior and beliefs, it's mostly often used in healthcare and education. Questions people do usually ask are things such as How and Why which are called open ended questions. These questions can be quite hard, there are also other types of things they do such as Naturalistic which can be things to do with research studies phenomena in their natural way. Another way qualitive research can be termed by is multiple systems of inquiry meaning they can use variety of methods of historical analysis and also case studies.  </p>
        <h3>Quantitative Research. Pritha Bhandari. (2022). What Is Quantitative Research? </h3>
        <p>Quantitative research is a strategy that uses numbers and an objective stance to collect and analyze data. This shows us that it's used to generate knowledge and to make people understand about the social world, and can be associated with the natural, applied, formal and social sciences. Another thing quantitative research does is that it can be counted or compared on a numeric scale, often to address what or how many aspects of a research question. </p>
        <h3>Why is Quantitative and Qualitative Research important</h3>
        <p> When creating a 2D game, both quantitative and qualitative research are essential, but they each provide different types of information that help in different ways. Quantitative research focuses on collecting numerical data that can be measured and analyzed. During the game development phase, this involves tracking how long players spend on a particular level, how many players complete certain objectives, or what percentage of players quit the game at certain points. These numbers help developers know the patterns and problems within the game's structure. For example, if many players are getting stuck at a certain level, the data will show that the level is too difficult, and adjustments must be needed to make it more balanced. Quantitative research helps to make the game more playable, ensuring that mechanics and challenges are fun and completable for the player.  Although qualitative research looks at the player's personal experiences and opinions about the game. This type of research involves interviews, focus groups, or open-ended questions where players explain what they liked, what frustrated them, and how the game made them feel overall. For a 2D game, the art style, music, and storyline are often key features, qualitative insights are always valuable because they provide a deeper understanding of how players connect with the game. For example, players might talk about how a particular character design made them feel towards the story or how the atmosphere of a level affected their enjoyment and playability. While quantitative data shows the facts, qualitative research uses the human perspective, showing how the game affects players on a personal level. Both types of research are necessary because quantitative data ensures the game functions well, while qualitative feedback helps make the game memorable and engaging for players. </p> 
        <h3>Primary Research. Smartline International Ltd. </h3>
        <p> Primary research is data which is obtained first-hand. This means that the researcher conducts the research themselves or commissions the data to be collected on their behalf. Primary research means going directly to the source, rather than relying on pre-existing data samples. </p>
        <h3>Secondary Research. Tegan George. (2023)</h3>
        <p>Secondary research is a research method that uses data that was collected by someone else. In other words, whenever you conduct research using data that already exists, you are conducting secondary research. </p>
        <h3>Why is Primary and Secondary Research important</h3>
        <p> When creating a 2D game, its important to gather information, you can do this through primary and secondary research. Primary research is when you collect information yourself. For example, if you want to know what players like in a game, you can ask them directly. You can also create a survey or interview players to learn about their favorite games, characters, or features. Another way you can do primary research is by watching people while they play games made by other companies. You should watch how they interact with the game, how and what makes them excited, or what frustrates them. You can even make a simple version of your game and invite your friends to play your game. By watching them play, you can see what they enjoy or find difficult. This feedback is valuable because it comes directly from the people who play and test your game. </p>
        <p> On the other hand, secondary research involves using information that someone else has already made. This can be articles, books, websites, or videos about game design and player preferences. For example, you can read articles about popular 2D games to understand how and what makes them successful. You could also watch YouTube videos that teach you about game development or read reviews of other games to see what players liked or didnt like. Secondary research is usually quicker than primary research because you dont have to collect the data yourself. </p>
        <p>Both primary and secondary research are important for creating a successful 2D game. Primary research gives you fresh ideas and direct feedback from players, while secondary research helps you learn from the experiences of others. By combining both types of research, you can create a 2d game that people will enjoy and will keep playing and share with their friends. </p>

        <h3>Case Study: Hollow Knight. Team Cherry. (2017)</h3>
        <p>Game Title: Hollow Knight Platforms and Release Date: Hollow Knight was released on February 24, 2017, for PC. It later came to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and macOS.</p>
        <p>Main Story: In Hollow Knight, you play as a small warrior called the Knight. The Knight explores the ruined kingdom of Hallow nest. Once a great place, hallow nest is now mostly empty and full of dangerous creatures. As you explore, you learn about the kingdoms fall and fight enemies to uncover its secrets.</p>

        <p>Storyline: The story is about uncovering the history of the fallen kingdom, hallow nest, as you explore deeper into its mysteries. </p>
        <h3>Case Study Comparison</h3>
        <p>Celeste and Hollow Knight are both cool games, but they are different from each other. In both games, you must jump around and avoid things, but how you play them isnt the same. </p>
        <p>In Celeste, you play as a girl named Madeline. She is trying to climb a big mountain called Celeste Mountain. But the aim isn't just about climbing. Shes also trying to face her fears and feelings while going up the mountain. Sometimes she gets scared, but she keeps trying. In Hollow Knight, you play as a small warrior called the Knight. The Knight doesnt talk, and you dont know anything about him. He is exploring a huge underground kingdom called Hollownest, which is very spooky and full of bugs. The Knight must fight enemies while learning what happened to the kingdom. </p>
        <p>The way you play is different. In Celeste, you must jump, climb walls, and dash through tricky levels. The game can be tricky, but you can try again quickly if you mess up. There isnt enemies to fight; its all about making hard jumps. But in Hollow Knight, you must explore a big, connected world. The Knight gets new powers as you play, and you can go back to places you have been to find new areas. There are loads of enemies to fight, and you even must battle big bosses. The Knight uses a sword called a nail to fight, so the game is about fighting and exploring. </p>
        <p>The way the games look is also different. Celeste has pixel art, so it looks more like 2d with little squares that make up the characters and the world. Each part of the mountain is different, like some places are snowy and others are caves. Hollow Knight has hand drawn graphics, so it is really detailed. The world is dark and set in caves and old cities. The characters and enemies look like bugs, and the whole place feels spooky. </p>
        <p>The stories are different, too. In Celeste, the story is about Madeline trying to climb the mountain and face her own problems. Its a very personal story about her feelings. But in Hollow Knight, the story is more about the kingdom of Hallow nest. As the Knight, you explore the kingdom and figure out what happened to it. You must discover the story by exploring and talking to other characters. </p>
        <p>Both games are fun and have you jumping around, they are not the same. Celeste is all about climbing and facing your fears, while Hollow Knight is more about exploring, fighting, and finding out what happened to a lost kingdom. Both are great platformers, but they offer very different. </p>
        <p>In my opinion i think they are both great games and are both really enjoyable to play they arent to tricky or too easy and both have an amazing story line within the game too and they both use two different art styles which makes them both stand out from other games and have their own feel and twist to 2d platformers. </p>
