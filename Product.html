    <h1>Player Design</h1>
    <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="character.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I draw this in pixel art for the player character. I used this design as i feel like it fit alot better for my game style and art style than any other character design i could come up with.</p>

         <h1>Level Sprites</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="levelsprites.png" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I made this inside of pixel art. I decide on this tile set as it stays in my design of a cave like game style which leads to what i wrote in my GDD and my research. </p>
        <h1>Collectable</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="collectable.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I used a coin for my collectable as in the games i researched they also used some sort of coin so i thought it would also fit my game design too so i drew animations inside of pixel art to make the coin</p>
         <h1>Bounce Pad</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="mushroom.png" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I used a mushroom for my bounce pad because it fit the stlye of a cave and i used a bounce pad because most 2d platformers have some sort of bounce pad to use to be able to get to certain places.</p>
            <h1>Boss</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="boss.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I decide on this boss because i thought it added a bit of a unkown feel seeing a giant alien to fit in the cave without even knowing it was there i feel like this added a bit of mystery into the game.</p>
        <h1>Player Hud</h1>
         
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="playerhud.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I used this player hud as i liked the hud style from games like God of War or Zelda and i thought it would fit really well inot my gamn which it did</p>
        <h1>Boss Hud</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="bosshud.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>This hud is the same as the player this was just for the boss so the player was able to see the bosses health and know how close to beating it they was</p>
         <h1>Main Menu</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="mainmenu.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p> I choose this menu design because i thought  it would fit really well  with the game style and i think it added a good style to the game</p>
            <h1>Options Menu</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="options.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I choose this menu design because i thought  it would fit really well  with the game style and i think it added a good style to the game. This just showed the player what the buttons was to control the player and interact with the world</p>

        <h1> Game Completed</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="gamecomplete.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I choose this menu design because i thought  it would fit really well  with the game style and i think it added a good style to the game. This tells the player that was able to finish the game and complete it fully</p>

        <h1>Death Screen</h1>
        <!-- Image Below Text -->
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="deathscreen.jpg" class="small-image">
        </div>
        <p>I choose this menu design because i thought  it would fit really well  with the game style and i think it added a good style to the game. This also added the screen to show that they failed with a red text saying game over.</p>
